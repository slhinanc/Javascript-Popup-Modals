### I did a widely used project for idea of Popup and Modal sample. you can easily understand the codes and get notion what is going on. Display property has an incredible importance both in CSS and in Javascript for the project to hide and show popup images, In addition to that there are a few codes in Javascript part including;
#### forEach
#### addEventListener("click")
#### arrow function () => {}
#### if ()

### Enjoy the codes.
